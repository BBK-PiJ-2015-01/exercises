 1.	(a)  Briefly describe the Strategy Design Pattern?
	(b)  When is it appropriate to use the Strategy Design Pattern?
	
	(a) The Strategy pattern allows class functionality to be implemented by external classes.
	(b)	The Strategy pattern is used to implement class behaviour through composition as opposed to inheritance. 
		Behaviour is defined through interfaces which are aggregated within a class and implemented through separate 
		concrete classes. This also lends itself to dependency injection.

3.	When is it appropriate to use the Abstract Factory design pattern?

	This pattern is used to specify the behaviour of groups of factories that produce related products. 
	
5. 	"In general, the details of object construction, such as instantiating and initialising the components that comprise the 
	object, are	kept within the object, often as part of its constructor.‚Äù

	Comment on this statement with reference to modularity and construction bloat.

7.	(a)	What is the Facade Pattern?
	(b)	When, and why, would you use the Facade Pattern?
	
9.	When should one make use of the Bridge Design Pattern?

11.	(a)	What is the Composite Pattern?
	(b)	Under what conditions would you use a Composite Design Pattern?
	(c)	What are the four participants of the Composite Design Pattern?
