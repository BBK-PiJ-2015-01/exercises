Session 3 Short form answers

1. 	Abstract classes can have state whereas interfaces cannot.
	A class can inherit from only one abstract class but can implement many interfaces.
	
	
2.	
	a.	False. e.g. Serializable
	b.	
	c.	

3.	Any interface that declares default methods.

	interface Structure {
	
		default void clear () {
			System.out.println("clear() not implemented.");
	}
	
4.	Adapter classes allow simple concrete classes to inherit from them and only provide behaviour for a single method.
	The adapter superclass implements empty methods that satisfy the interface contract. These are commonly used in GUI
	applications where the developer doesn't want to implement a whole class for a single method.
	
	class SimpleWindowAdapter extends WindowAdapter {
	
		public void windowClosing() {
		
		// The only method in which we are interested. Some implementation code here...
		}
	}
	
5.	A class can have a private constructor and a factory method to control instantiation. This is the basis of the 
	SIngleton pattern

	public class SingleClass {
		...
		private SingleClass() {
			// only SingleClass can instantiate
		}
		
		public static SingleClass getInstance() {
		
			// decide whether to provide an instance
	}

6.	A object instantiation may take significant resources to implement e.g. database connections and may 
	be lazy-instantiated to enable applications to start up faster or consume remote resources only when required.
	
7.	public class Controller extends Observable {

		void observersNeedNotifyingOfThis() {
		
			// when observers need notifying
			setChanged();
			notifyObservers();
		}
		
	} 
	
	public class ObserverClass implements Observer {
	
		Observable notifier;
		
		public void setNotifier(Observable notifier) {

			// obtain an instance of the Observable , possibly from DI
			this.notifier = notifier;
			notifier.register(this);
		}
		
		@Override
		update(Observable o, Object arg) {
			// code to handle notification from notifier ...
		}
	}
